The Staff-Onboarding PowerShell script pulls information from an Excel file called Staff-AccountData. Below, I will explain the purpose of each sheet. At the end of this document, I have listed some ideas and improvements that I am considering.

The ideal of this script is to be able to use this anywhere without modifying the script. Only setting up the Excel file. Which should be static to some degree. 

Important Note:
Each sheet contains a header. Do not modify the header as it aligns with the script's functionality.

Sheet: "Job Title Groups"
>  Column A contains "Group#". The "Group#" should increment according to the job title that has the most security groups associated with it.
>  The first row lists each job title.
> Leave A1 blank.

Sheet: "Department Manager"
>  The manager's name should go under the "Manager" header, and the department name should be under the "Department" header.

Sheet: "Department OU"
>  Department column must align with the "OUPath" column.
>  Department names go under the "Department" header, and their corresponding OU paths go under the "OUPath" header.

Sheet: "Domain"
>  Only edit the OU path for EnabledOU and DisabledOU. 

Sheet: "Office OU"
>  The "Office" column must align with the "OUPath" column.

Sheet: "Office Location"
>  The "Department" column must match the "Office" column.
